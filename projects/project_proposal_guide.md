Project Proposal and Presentation Guide
==============

The purpose of group projects is to reinforce the coding skills you have learned, to combine concepts, and to code collabratively. It is an opportunity to explore real world problems, implement problem solving skills, and to experience peer to peer learning.  

## Strong project proposals and project-end presentations satisfy the following points:

- 1 page total (text and figures)

- Description of problem, biological or other (3-4 sentences)

- Proposed programming solution (1-3 sentences per sub-point)
    - Overview of features/stages/components to be implemented
    - How the proposed code solves the problem
    - Desired inputs (data sets, files etc)
    - Desired outputs (files, output to screen, plots, web pages, etc)
    - Potential challenges that may be encountered

- Anticipated programming concepts (logic, data structures, modules, algorithms, *etc*.) to be used in implementing the solution (1-2 sentences for each concept)

## Strong final project presentations integrate:
- Live demos (on command line or in Jupyter notebook)
- Code walk-throughs/highlights
- Discussion of lessons learned
- Future directions/improvements


## Project Rules
- Projects should be focused on programming therefore no project or propsals should be dependent on running applications and making pipelines.
- All data should be preexisting and downloadable, or you need to create a fake dataset. Data has to be approved or provided by TA.
- Data can not be owned by any memeber of the project group.
- All code should have postive and negative controls
- Datasets should be small for development. Larger datasets can be used once all code is complete and working as expected.
- TAs are there to advise not to code.
- All project groups should create a new github repository.
