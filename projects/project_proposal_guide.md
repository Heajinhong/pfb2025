Project Proposal and Presentation Guide
=======================================

Strong project proposals and project-end presentations satisfy the following points:

- Description of problem, biological or other (3-4 sentences)

- Proposed programming solution (1-3 sentences per sub-point)
    - Overview of features/stages/components to be implemented
    - How the proposed program/software solves the problem
    - Desired inputs (data sets, files etc)
    - Desired outputs (files, output to screen, plots, etc)
    - Potential challenges that may be encountered

- Anticipated programming concepts (logic, data structures, modules, algorithms, *etc*.) to be used in implementing the solution (1-2 sentences for each concept)

In addition to discussing the above points, strong presentations integrate:

- Live demos (on command line or in Jupyter notebook)
- Code walk-throughs/highlights
- Discussion of lessons learned
- Future directions/improvements

Project Rules
==========
- Projects should be focused on programming therefore no project or propsals should be dependent on running applications and making pipelines.
- All data should be preexisting and downloadable, or you need to create a fake dataset. Data has to be approved or provided by TA.
- Data can not be owned by any memeber of the project group.
- All code should have postive and negative controls
- Datasets should be small for development. Larger datasets can be used once all code is complete and working as expected.
- TAs are there to advise not to code.
- All project groups should create a new github repository.
