# Microbial Mayhem
---

### Short summary

Microbial interactions shape the diversity of life. Biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) are
contiguous groups of genes within microbial genomes that work in concert to produce
complex bioactive molecules. These molecules, often secondary metabolites, can mediate
various interactions between microbes, including competition, communication, and
cooperation. In this project, we will design a game that tests the capabilities of different
microbes to compete against each other, based on various factors including their
biosynthetic gene content.

# PFBseq
---

### Short summary
PFBseq is a pipeline for integrating analyses of ChIP-seq, CITE-seq, and scRNA-seq data. The pipeline calls ChIP-seq peaks, annotates nearest transcription start sites, calculates log fold change, performes single-cell clustering and identification, generates UMAP and other diagnostic plots, and GO annotation enrichment of significantly up-regulated genes.
