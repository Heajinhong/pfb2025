# Write a script that uses range() in a for loop to print out every number between 0 and 99

# Modify your loop to print out every number between 1 and 100.
# Create a new script that uses list comprehension to do the same thing as problem 8. (Use range() to print out every number between 1 and 100.)

# Write a new script that takes the start and end values from the command line. If you call your script like this count.py 3 10 it will print the numbers from 3 to 10.

# Modify your script so that it will only print the number if it is odd.
# Write a new script to create a list with the following data ['ATGCCCGGCCCGGC','GCGTGCTAGCAATACGATAAACCGG', 'ATATATATCGAT','ATGGGCCC']. Use a for loop to iterate through each element of this list and:

# Print out each element.
# Print out the length and the sequence, separated by a tab. The output should look like:
# 14	ATGCCCGGCCCGGC
# 25	GCGTGCTAGCAATACGATAAACCGG
# 12	ATATATATCGAT
# 8	ATGGGCCC
# Use list comprehension to generate a list of tuples. The tuples should contain sequences and lengths from the previous problem. Print out the length and the sequence (i.e., "4\tATGC\n"). A list of tuples looks like this [(4,'ATGC'),(2,'GC')].

# Modify the script from #11 so that you also print out the number (position in the list) of each sequence (i.e., "1\t4\tACGT\n")

# Have you been committing you work?
